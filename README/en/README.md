## Download üì•
You can [download](https://github.com/i-decosmis/HTS_KSE_VE_CONV/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) the zip file or clone the repository.
* Extract the folder from the downloaded zip.
* The folders containing the images and the compressed PSD file are `Poker Size` and `Tarot Size`.
* The `Open Sans and Patua One` folder contains fonts needed to open the PSD project; everything is explained below.

## Video Tutorial üé•
I've uploaded a video tutorial that explains the steps for translating a card: [Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSjCtiTquEM)

## What's Included üßê
* **PNG files** for each expansion (KSE, VE, CONV), divided by language (Italian and English).
* **PSD files** for both poker- and tarot-sized cards, prepared with the Make Playing Cards (MPC) template.
* **Editable Monster and Party Leader cards** without names, so you can add translations using the provided PSD files.
* A **complete Italian translation** for all cards.

## File Organization üìå
The files are organized into two main folders:
* **Poker Size**
* **Tarot Size**

Each folder contains both PSD *comp and PNG files, organized by card type and including card backs.

### PNG Organization üñºÔ∏è
All PNG files are ready for upload to the [Make Playing Cards](https://www.makeplayingcards.com/) site, with details as follows:
* [Poker Size: 63 x 88mm](https://www.makeplayingcards.com/design/custom-blank-card.html)
* [Tarot Size](https://www.makeplayingcards.com/design/design-your-own-tarot-cards.html)

Cards are organized by category (e.g., `Challenges`) and then by language and expansion. Each expansion includes two versions:

* **With Label**: Custom labels created to distinguish cards by category, like:<br />
  <img src="../../Poker Size\Heroes\ENG\KSE\With Label\Renovern.png" alt="Logo" width="350">

* **Without Label**: Standard cards without custom labels, for example:<br />
  <img src="../../Poker Size\Heroes\ENG\KSE\Without Label\Renovern.png" alt="Logo" width="350">

> Note: For `The Rhythmic Archer` card, I chose to keep the original label intact, so this card appears with a label in all versions.

## PSD File Details üì∏
**REQUIREMENTS**:
* Install the fonts found in the `Open Sans and Patua One` folder. For `Open Sans`, I recommend installing the two ttf files in the `Open_Sans` folder and ignoring the `static` folder.

Unzip the PSD file you want to work on from the 7z archive, then open it.

In the Photoshop files, each expansion is organized by category (e.g., `Challenges`) and labeled by expansion (e.g., `KSE`). For each **card folder** in the PSD file, you‚Äôll find the following layers:
* **KSE/VE/CONV Layer**: A label layer created for each expansion. (For the card `Sorcerer Challenge`, the label was slightly adjusted to avoid covering the card name).
* **ITA Layer**: The final image in Italian.
* **ITA Folder**: Contains the Italian names and descriptions positioned on each card. **You can use these as a template for translating to other languages**.
* **Hide Layer**: Hides the English text from the base card image.
* **No Name Layer (for Monsters and Party Leaders only)**: A version of the card with the name removed.
* **English Layer**: The base card in English.

## FAQ ‚ùì
**Q: Why did you only move the label on the `Sorcerer Challenge` card and not on all the other cards to keep them consistent?**

A: I prefer the label to stay at that precise, consistent height across all cards, because I like it. For most cards, this position works perfectly without obscuring important details. However, on the `Sorcerer Challenge` card, the label would cover part of the name, so I adjusted the height slightly for this card only to ensure the name remains visible.

**Q: What settings should I use to print cards on the [Make Playing Cards](https://www.makeplayingcards.com/) website?**

A: I‚Äôll be placing the order soon, and these are the settings I‚Äôll use:
* Card Stock: M29 (from this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HereToSlay/comments/w7u6fc/does_anyone_know_what_type_of_cardstock_the_cards/)).
* Print Type: Full Color Print.
* Finish: MPC card finish (from this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mpcproxies/comments/rycpki/mpc_card_stock_options_a_review/)).
* Other options up to your preference.

As soon as I receive the physical cards, I'll update with my feedback.
